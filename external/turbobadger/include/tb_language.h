	or the hash number from a string (done by TBID).

	Ex: GetString(10)      (Get the string with id 10)
	Ex: GetString("new")   (Get the string with id new)

	In UI resources, you can refer to strings from language lookup by preceding a string with @.

	Ex: TBButton: text: @close   (Create a button with text from lookup of "close")
