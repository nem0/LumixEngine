		with some extra work that might eat up a considerable time of the total duration (and
		chop of the beginning of it).

		F.ex: Creating a window and starting its appearance animation. During initialization
		of the window, you might initiate loading of additional resources. When that is done

		have passed. If the animation start time is adjusted to the first update, the whole
