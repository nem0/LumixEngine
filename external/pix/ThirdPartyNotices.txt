SQLITE3 NOTICES AND INFORMATION BEGIN HERE
==========================================

https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html
SQLite Is Public Domain

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public
domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies
they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the
public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe
at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use,
compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code
form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and
by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite -
those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger
application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the "configure"
scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing
from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however,
and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing
your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been
taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced
back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications
on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code
from other projects.
