# Type Checking

## Enabling Luau Type Checking in VS Code

1. Install the [Luau language server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.luau-lsp) for VS Code.
2. Open the `data` folder in VS Code.
3. Create a VS Code workspace settings file at `data/.vscode/settings.json`.
4. Add the following JSON configuration:
	```json
	{
		"luau-lsp.types.definitionFiles": ["scripts/black.h.d.lua"]
	}
	```
5. Create a `.luaurc` file in the `data/scripts/` directory with the following content:
	```json
	{
		"languageMode": "nonstrict",
		"lint": { "*": true, "FunctionUnused": false },
		"lintErrors": true,
		"globals": ["expect"]
	}
	```
6. Type checking should now be enabled. You can test it with the following script:
	```lua
	function onInputEvent(event : InputEvent)
		return event.some_prop
	end
	```

## black.h Type Definitions

black.h type definitions are available in the [black.h.d.lua](../../data/scripts/black.h.d.lua) file. This file is generated by Meta tool.

## Type checking inside Studio

To enable Luau type checking (including autocomplete and go-to-definition) in Studio, you must build Luau from source code as a static library. See the [third-party](../3rdparty.md) page for instructions on compiling Luau from source.
