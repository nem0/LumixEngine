# How to download plugins
1. Execute [scripts/plugins.bat](../scripts/plugins.bat).
2. Select the desired plugin.
3. Regenerate the solution (e.g., run [scripts/create_vs22_sln.bat](../scripts/create_vs22_sln.bat)).
4. Build and run the solution.

Plugins downloaded this way are placed in the `plugins` directory. *GENie* automatically detects all plugins in this directory and includes them in the solution.
